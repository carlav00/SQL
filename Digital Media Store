/*For this SQL project, I analyzed a dataset called "chinook," which represents a digital media store 
and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices and customers.
Using this dataset in SQLiteStudio (3.3.3), I answered multiple questions using the following written SQL queries */

/*Show Customers(full name, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US*/

SELECT 
    FirstName, 
    LastName, 
    CustomerId,
    Country 
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country != 'USA';

/*Show only the Customers from Brazil*/
SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

/*Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. 
The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.*/
